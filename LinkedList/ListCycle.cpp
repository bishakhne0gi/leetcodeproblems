/** 
There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
Example 3:


Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

/**ALGO
 *  Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm 
Approach: This is the fastest method and has been described below:  

Traverse linked list using two pointers.
Move one pointer(slow_p) by one and another pointer(fast_p) by two.
If these pointers meet at the same node then there is a loop. If pointers do not meet then linked list doesnâ€™t have a loop.
